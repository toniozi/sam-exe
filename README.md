There is a application, called 'SAM the software speech synthesizer', which can say anything you write.
Unfortunately, you have to type everything in the console - which is fine with me - but I wanted to challenge myself. 
So I wrote a simple python program and turned it into a .exe file. It provides a User Interface for SAM.

You just have to put it in SAM's folder. https://simulationcorner.net
